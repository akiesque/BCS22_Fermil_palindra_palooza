## Reflection/things I've learned: I believe stacks are VERY tricky to
## use and implement. But as long as you remember 'last in, first out',
## I think its also very fun. I'm very curious of other ways to use it
## and might use it for other personal coding projects in the future.

## On the other hand, what I enjoy the most is looping and printing
## through lists, I think that its very fulfilling to see contents 
## of the list come one by one together into a full idea, I think
## this is one of my favorites about lists.
